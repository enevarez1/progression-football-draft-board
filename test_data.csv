20,first,player,WR,21,Strategic,72,196,Oregon,Seagulls,Pacific Northwest,1,Media,13,3,80,2,65,10001,"Carter should be an early backup with the potential to eventually step into a starting role. Bruce does not have excellent hands and is thus not a real threat to create interceptions and make game-changing plays on defense. He is a poor blitzer who lacks vision and the ability to fight through blocks. He is susceptible to giving up some separation early in routes as he turns to trailing technique. Bruce is a dynamic defender in the middle of the field thanks to being extremely well-rounded. Bruce is also a willing run defender who will contribute to the ground defense and tackle. He fights off blocks, fires to the ball, and shows nice tackling technique for a corner. Our scouts noted Bruce's play was consistently impressive. Carter looks like a potential first- or second-round pick for the  2025 PFL Draft. Carter is a player that has the potential to become an All-Pro someday. "
